# Morse Code Translator

## Overview
Morse code is a telecommunication method that encodes text characters as sequences of two different signal durations called dots (·) and dashes (-). It was widely used for long-distance communication before the advent of modern technologies.

## Historical Context
Morse code was developed in the 1830s by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail for use with the telegraph system. It was created to enable efficient long-distance communication using electrical pulses over wires, revolutionizing communication during that era.

## How Morse Code Works
- Each letter, number, or punctuation mark is represented by a unique combination of dots and dashes
- Dots represent short signals, dashes represent longer signals (typically three times the duration of a dot)
- Letters are separated by short spaces, words by longer spaces
- The system is based on frequency of use - commonly used letters have shorter codes

## Examples
- HELLO: ···· · ·—·· ·—·· ———
- WORLD: ·—— ——— ·—· ·—·· —··
- SOS (distress signal): ··· ——— ···
